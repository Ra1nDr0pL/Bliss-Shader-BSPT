Bliss-BSPT is an edited shader based on Bliss-unstable-development by X0nk.
The original Bliss is a great shader and it's even better when X0nk made unstable development version of it.
But it's also kinda broken with tons of bugs, so I decided to fix them myself and merge code from FAYER3's blocklight2 fork.
I called it BSPT which refers to "block shadow path tracing" at that time,
but as I start to change things, add new stuffs like aurora and ripples, improve the performance, the block shadow part becomes less important.
So it's not matter why it called BSPT today, I just what to make a super Bliss loved by everyone.
