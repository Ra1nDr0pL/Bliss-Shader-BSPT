The original Bliss is a great shader and it's even better when X0nk made unstable development version of it.<br>
But it's also kinda broken with tons of bugs, so I decided to fix them myself and merge code from FAYER3's blocklight2 fork.<br>
I called it BSPT which refers to "Block Shadow Path Tracing" at that time, <br>
but as I start add new stuffs like aurora, ripples and lensflare, improve the performance, the block shadow part becomes less important. <br>
So it doesn't matter why it's called BSPT today, I just what to make a ultra Bliss loved by everyone. <br>
